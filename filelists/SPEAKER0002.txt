000020003.WAV|Finally, they went back to their car and their hearts ached upon seeing the visible scratches and bite marks that had been inflicted.
000020005.WAV|Rubber boots are not popular in Singapore despite our rainy weather.
000020006.WAV|They fed their hungry stomachs with the egg and ham sandwiches that Mary’s mother had made.
000020007.WAV|The veteran fought to protect his country during the war.
000020008.WAV|As they walked back, they were shocked to see a pack of stray dogs circling around the car.
000020009.WAV|Chilli crab is a famous dish in Singapore.
000020010.WAV|All good citizens should learn how to change a light bulb.
000020011.WAV|I need your help.
000020012.WAV|Cinderella’s dress transformed exactly at twelve o’ clock.
000020013.WAV|The main actor of the movie has arrived at the premiere.
000020014.WAV|This ladder leads to another path.
000020015.WAV|A child prodigy, James eventually became a respected judge.
000020016.WAV|He gulped down his beer.
000020017.WAV|He told them that it was rare for tourists to make a stop at this area.
000020018.WAV|The child divulged all his secrets to his best friend.
000020020.WAV|The student skated onto the stage to receive his certificate
000020021.WAV|A diamond is not a woman’s best friend.
000020023.WAV|The workers braved through sun and rain every day just to build the tunnel.
000020024.WAV|The thief was careful to not leave his tracks in the snow.
000020027.WAV|My uncle is thirty years younger than me.
000020028.WAV|The little boy shared his tomato with his brother.
000020029.WAV|The young girl washed her shoes on her own.
000020032.WAV|They tried to keep it a secret, but he was able to figure everything out.
000020033.WAV|A range of sandpaper is used to make the surface smooth.
000020034.WAV|We know more about space than the seasons and the seas.
000020035.WAV|She scooped herself a big bowl of corn soup.
000020036.WAV|The land’s deed was sold to the old lady.
000020038.WAV|Most youths today think that their future is uncertain.
000020039.WAV|It is more important to study smart than to study hard.
000020040.WAV|Hold your bat steady and focus your eyes on the ball.
000020041.WAV|After driving for ten years, her car is still in tip-top condition.
000020042.WAV|Finish this by tomorrow or else you’ll be fired!
000020043.WAV|The fly was caught in the spider’s web.
000020044.WAV|There’s something about hotel beds that makes them extra cosy.
000020045.WAV|The little girl played with her rabbit and geese in the yard.
000020047.WAV|He writhed in pain and gasped for air.
000020048.WAV|They brought some clothes and three days’ worth of food and water in their car.
000020049.WAV|You can bake shortbread cookies just with sugar, butter, and flour.
000020050.WAV|We made verbal vows to each other in the past, but it was a futile attempt.
000020051.WAV|The charity run was held on a Tuesday.
000020052.WAV|They gird their loins for the challenge.
000020053.WAV|Mary fell asleep on her mother’s lap, beat from the whole ordeal.
000020054.WAV|With the movers hired to settle the rest of their luggage and furniture, they decided to take a short tour first of the harbour that was near their new home.
000020057.WAV|We now have to walk twenty minutes farther just to get a cup of coffee.
000020058.WAV|An old man who was putting down his gun appeared from the sunflower fields and hurried the shaken family to be on their way before the dogs return.
000020060.WAV|Just as they were trying to find a tool or two that they could use to fend off the dogs, one of the dogs spotted them.
000020062.WAV|We all knew that it was the calm before the storm.
000020063.WAV|He was the president of the dance club in my school.
000020064.WAV|I attached a mirror to my closet door.
000020065.WAV|Song sheets for xylophones are on the shelf to your right.
000020066.WAV|Pink was a colour of health.
000020067.WAV|A murder had already been plotted a month ago.
000020070.WAV|The guards can’t laugh when they are on duty.
000020073.WAV|I had a lot of questions about the assignment.
000020074.WAV|Twins often have a unique chemistry with each other.
000020075.WAV|That man is an aircraft engineer.
000020078.WAV|He is a lightweight in alcohol.
000020079.WAV|Our sports teams have achieved remarkable feats this year.
000020080.WAV|The student was very confused until he realised he entered the wrong classroom.
000020082.WAV|My winter jacket came with a detachable hood.
000020084.WAV|It was a miracle that he recovered from his life-threatening accident.
000020085.WAV|I get free snacks whenever I go to the supermarket.
000020087.WAV|He became very fit ever since his break-up last year.
000020088.WAV|People tend to over-eat while watching the television.
000020091.WAV|He hurt himself while slicing the meat.
000020092.WAV|After their satisfying lunch, the family took a nap with the grass as their bed.
000020093.WAV|Just because I tolerated, he thought I was a fool.
000020094.WAV|Please pass your exam once and for all.
000020096.WAV|She is a deep sleeper.
000020099.WAV|There were barrels of wine in the huge cellar.
000020100.WAV|The van travelled slowly on the expressway.
000020101.WAV|Current events may also trigger memories that involve a need to stockpile items of value.
000020103.WAV|So it's essential that the Tamil letters are selected carefully, as they've done so here.
000020107.WAV|The frequency of tree inspection and pruning varies according to location, species, age and tree condition.
000020108.WAV|After almost six hours she died of cardiac arrest.
000020109.WAV|And if your technology is deep, it will probably take competitors a while to catch up.
000020112.WAV|Even now, all the big countries say they have missed a great friend.
000020113.WAV|A shorter lease would mean more savings for my retirement, so why not?
000020114.WAV|But we usually do no matter what.
000020116.WAV|But her memory is so good, she couldn't have made mistake.
000020117.WAV|The Australian dollar gained, while bond yields fell.
000020120.WAV|Expect hours to be wasted reading how diabolical some of these emails go.
000020121.WAV|The campaign aims to educate Singaporeans on sustainable practices in the production of palm oil.
000020123.WAV|Because America will not tolerate it.
000020124.WAV|Well you can't really name your restaurant 'Chicken' can you?
000020126.WAV|Parents who live in Woodlands are looking forward to the refreshing concept of the upcoming childcare centre.
000020127.WAV|Fathers and daughters do not use such language, and I was taken aback.
000020131.WAV|Are you washing your hair during confinement?
000020134.WAV|But women do this all the time, they don't get glory.
000020136.WAV|Compared to other markets, the housing market is particularly prone to speculative booms and bust.
000020137.WAV|Mandatory block leave is also practised in the private sector.
000020138.WAV|Gifts of gold are traditional for weddings and births.
000020139.WAV|How should the government acknowledge the undercurrents in the community and adapt in light of greater demands for transparency?
000020140.WAV|Always wanted to take a peek into your child's world at school?
000020143.WAV|Rainfall is expected to be slightly below average.
000020144.WAV|At least it doesn't nag.
000020145.WAV|Even as Singapore went through changes, he wanted to see how it developed.
000020147.WAV|He also leaves his fortune in a trust for various charities here and elsewhere.
000020148.WAV|About two out of three were male.
000020149.WAV|He added that collection information will be sent to applicants when the tags are ready.
000020151.WAV|I found it so stressful and I couldn't take it.
000020152.WAV|Details on when or how an injunction will be lifted are being worked out.
000020153.WAV|Entering the high growth logistics sector in India helps us to diversify our asset portfolio.
000020154.WAV|As such, there could still be sharp spikes from time to time this year.
000020155.WAV|If economic conditions become favourable and our price target is achieved, we will normalise monetary policy.
000020157.WAV|Being old and frail puts one at a high risk of developing dementia.
000020158.WAV|But it is a job that requires constant alertness and vigilance all round.
000020159.WAV|He added that Mr Tan remains an important member of his team, though in a different role.
000020163.WAV|Attendance to the sessions are through invitation only.
000020164.WAV|Besides the Call Police app, other highlights included a marketing campaign to end the stigma against dyslexia.
000020165.WAV|Any policy or ruling that will help the industry the borrower at large will benefit everybody.
000020166.WAV|But he said the sacrifice is worth it.
000020167.WAV|I get to choose first which vinyls I want to keep for myself, he says with a smile.
000020168.WAV|Printer companies earn far higher margins on replacement cartridges than on printers, which are often sold cheaply.
000020169.WAV|And hopefully, there will be the right person who is not intimidated.
000020170.WAV|But after taking the sale proceeds, they treat the parents shabbily, some even throwing the parents out.
000020171.WAV|According to the report, mediums were engaged to try to exorcise the poltergeists but to no avail.
000020172.WAV|According to psychiatric reports quoted by the prosecution today, Tan has paranoid schizophrenia that remains untreated.
000020173.WAV|Both are still warded in the intensive care unit.
000020174.WAV|But I can only say if you want to be in a business, you must have that.
000020175.WAV|Mr Obama will be meeting with members of the Vietnamese civil society.
000020176.WAV|All this, to help a Singaporean guest create the perfect surprise wedding proposal.
000020177.WAV|And it was a very mature view, but that they continue to move forward.
000020179.WAV|A lot goes into preparation.
000020180.WAV|He also called for contributors to submit opinion articles and news for the site.
000020181.WAV|He suggested that this class be defined as broadly as possible.
000020185.WAV|Here and there were signs of the pandemonium for which Black Friday was long known.
000020186.WAV|And because they themselves are from disadvantaged backgrounds, they know there are others who are like them as well.
000020187.WAV|Is the younger generation of Singaporeans indifferent towards politics and Singapore's future?
000020188.WAV|But we have to make sure that the skills that they acquire are going to be relevant in the future.
000020189.WAV|As such, this trend is likely to continue.
000020190.WAV|Read the full Politico Magazine interview here.
000020191.WAV|I will be looking forward to that day.
000020194.WAV|And ultimately, Singapore's economy will simply crash.
000020196.WAV|There are buses, and there's always your two legs, what.
000020197.WAV|He always thought about his people.
000020200.WAV|Investors tend to overestimate it.
000020201.WAV|Most of those rejected could afford to purchase a small flat or had family support.
000020202.WAV|But my dad also always used to talk about the pristine beauty of that land.
000020203.WAV|And if the result is good, thumbs up man!
000020204.WAV|He is married to a teacher and the couple have seven children.
000020206.WAV|But in this case, the developer might choose to conserve it if the authorities approve.
000020208.WAV|Eight other similar offences were considered during sentencing.
000020210.WAV|My reason was always no time.
000020211.WAV|What if the jail term was real?
000020213.WAV|Here are the reasons why you'd want to give this popular American restaurant a try.
000020214.WAV|Check it out whenever you are nearby!
000020219.WAV|For businesses in Singapore keen to experiment in new markets, China presents a massive opportunity.
000020221.WAV|He added that his thoughts and prayers were with all those affected in the disaster.
000020225.WAV|He said that businesses need time to plan labour projections and a sudden policy change hurt businesses more.
000020226.WAV|Police have classified the case as murder.
000020233.WAV|Although the improvements shown among service providers here were worth celebrating, Mr Lee said they can do much better.
000020234.WAV|But she stopped herself when she felt dizzy and took a shower to freshen up.
000020235.WAV|I made good friends, and we still keep in touch.
000020237.WAV|We are determined, even with our finite resources, we will continue to be special.
000020238.WAV|If charged and convicted, the man could be jailed up to five years, fined, or both.
000020240.WAV|But tap water in Singapore is clean, safe to drink, and even contains fluoride which is good for one's teeth.
000020241.WAV|In any case, creeps are common enough that some karate skills seem to be in order.
000020242.WAV|A return to checkpoints would stir memories of decades of violence and also harm the island's economy.
000020243.WAV|All parties clarified that they did not engage any pest controllers to cull the stray cats.
000020244.WAV|I hope the museum can also produce a book featuring this collection to tell the Singapore story.
000020246.WAV|I gave one times the value, he gave away one half times the value.
000020247.WAV|It has resulted in the loss of lives including children, women and the elderly.
000020250.WAV|Barring any new developments, we do not expect many more arrests or repatriations related to this riot.
000020251.WAV|A simple majority of seats is required to rule.
000020253.WAV|Reunion dinners usually take place on the eve.
000020254.WAV|Some victims were threatened if they refused to comply.
000020256.WAV|A lot of it can be carried into everyday life.
000020257.WAV|As such, this may not be something to gloat about.
000020258.WAV|This causes the toxic haze which Singapore grapples with almost annually.
000020259.WAV|And then it struck me, like a thunder flash.
000020260.WAV|But it was in the midst of these high density tents that young love bloomed.
000020262.WAV|Every member was informed about the vote, but not everyone was allowed to vote.
000020267.WAV|I personally agonised over the decision and explored different possibilities.
000020268.WAV|Currently, there may not be any change in the consensus about how we should best be driving Singapore's economy.
000020270.WAV|A vote for us is a vote for certainty.
000020271.WAV|A university degree may not be the only passport to a good life.
000020273.WAV|Fewer than one in two Singaporeans have read at least one literary book a year.
000020275.WAV|But in secondary school, she wanted to change and make her parents proud.
000020279.WAV|Friday was another great day for tech manufacturing stocks in general.
000020281.WAV|A few months later, he travelled to South Africa where he was reunited with his family.
000020282.WAV|It shared the position with Japan and Austria this year.
000020283.WAV|Flynn lied, and they destroyed his life.
000020284.WAV|The turquoise railing that goes around the storefront, for example, is part of the original fixtures.
000020288.WAV|The prosecution has failed to show any evidence that I knew it was a sham.
000020289.WAV|But I came to the conclusion, what the heck.
000020290.WAV|And taxi drivers are convinced this is the way to go.
000020291.WAV|Even if the minor consented, the adult should know it's wrong.
000020293.WAV|Mr Cohen has said he paid it himself, through a company he set up.
000020295.WAV|All the stolen money was recovered.
000020296.WAV|At least the packaging is colourful.
000020297.WAV|The facility and its programme are designed such that children with special needs can learn alongside other children.
000020298.WAV|His wake was held at the Singapore Casket yesterday.
000020299.WAV|As a parent with special needs children, we are extremely disappointed with this scanning system.
000020300.WAV|But regardless of who they are counselling, the main message remains the same.
000020301.WAV|The proportion of Singaporeans that were unemployed declined during the quarter.
000020303.WAV|But one thing was missing.
000020305.WAV|And that's very costly for an average family.
000020306.WAV|I think it's the inevitable destiny of Singaporeans to plug into the world and compete on the world stage.
000020307.WAV|Fundamentally there still remains risk of default and if it runs out of money, its oil operations will be halted.
000020309.WAV|Despite the complexity and precision required of the machine, the prototype took less than three months to build.
000020310.WAV|But this time around, the collective sales cycle started from the mass market.
000020311.WAV|But it's important to you, isn't it?
000020312.WAV|During a fire drill, a bell would ring loud and clear through the school.
000020313.WAV|None of it was true.
000020314.WAV|But it gets even more strange.
000020316.WAV|From traditional to modern, there are sweets to make both the old generation and the young happy.
000020317.WAV|Absent also were the leftover cans and bottles, a common sight previously.
000020318.WAV|Being a good guy regardless of the mistakes I made.
000020322.WAV|Many of our retirees, they have assets but they don't have cash.
000020323.WAV|But he had wanted to do something about his marriage and attempted to see a marriage counsellor.
000020326.WAV|But when did these victims die and under what circumstances did they end up in a mass grave?
000020327.WAV|Of course this also means that occasionally you'll get that disgusting gob on your hair, shoes, pants, etc.
000020328.WAV|Outstanding leadership needed in the unions and at the national level.
000020329.WAV|Everyone has this experience that you try to figure out something and it does not come to you.
000020332.WAV|The victim is not named to protect the identity of her daughter.
000020333.WAV|Occasional slightly hazy conditions can be expected.
000020334.WAV|Fly too slowly and the pockets don't catch any air, causing the flag to fold onto itself.
000020335.WAV|Because if you do, every day will be a headache for you.
000020338.WAV|Last year, developers sold more homes than they launched.
000020339.WAV|Both have a few similar convictions back home.
000020340.WAV|It helps us very much in terms of funding.
000020342.WAV|And I will say they did very well.
000020343.WAV|He now faces one charge of causing hurt by wrapping his hands around the cabby's neck.
000020344.WAV|If we don't embrace it, it'll be very sad indeed.
000020345.WAV|It also had to prepare for life after the empire.
000020346.WAV|Life expectancy in Singapore is increasing.
000020348.WAV|I have put the case behind me and am trying to move on with my life.
000020350.WAV|He added that any intervention must be sensitively executed.
000020352.WAV|Granted, both the second and third PMs were chosen by the second and third generation leaders respectively.
000020355.WAV|Black spots can be roads undergoing major works or exposed to construction projects nearby.
000020356.WAV|As all natural evolution goes, everything will have its natural death.
000020359.WAV|The stakeholder simply makes the change, marketing approves it and it goes live.
000020360.WAV|But now it has reached a point where I have to choose either one.
000020361.WAV|A group of older boys made fun of me in school today, my son shared recently.
000020363.WAV|It's more than taking away money and subscriptions.
000020364.WAV|They, along with many other Singaporeans, would want to understand the basis of her decision.
000020365.WAV|It's now getting rid of both.
000020366.WAV|Another important consideration for parents was having an elder child in the same school.
000020367.WAV|But there is always light at the end of the tunnel.
000020368.WAV|Some even brought along their own bags of scrap cloth.
000020370.WAV|And that goes perfectly with how the band themselves see their music.
000020373.WAV|I had then left my previous job not to 'dive' into the floral business but to do a career switch.
000020375.WAV|It added that firms must continue to improve productivity and reduce reliance on manpower.
000020376.WAV|A diamond created by the earth in a natural setting would take about the same amount of time to form.
000020377.WAV|The conglomerate later issued a statement, posted on their official website.
000020378.WAV|Because that will be boring and predictable, isn't it?
000020379.WAV|Both girls were from the netball team and have been close friends since preschool.
000020380.WAV|He was an introverted child.
000020381.WAV|His ambition to become a chef was sparked after he watched celebrity chef Jamie Oliver on television.
000020382.WAV|Another revealing detail is that Twitter lets you see when its accounts are created.
000020385.WAV|But while that helped for a while, commuters are back to complaining about the crush during rush hour.
000020388.WAV|A lot of the time, I think it's the gutter.
000020390.WAV|Which also includes closing one eye sometimes.
000020391.WAV|Cyclists are a hazard on pedestrian pathways.
000020392.WAV|It's a tall order for you to follow but unfortunately that's the real world.
000020395.WAV|Glad that those contacted so far are safe.
000020396.WAV|A psychologist said getting Singaporeans to recognise that a terror threat is looming at their doorstep will not be easy.
000020397.WAV|And it was interesting for me to review what I had done well and what I had fouled up.
000020398.WAV|Extremely fragrant fried rice, made clay pot style, is cooked with trimmed beef fat and charred ends from the steak.
000020399.WAV|But there are, of course, sleepless nights and they are trying to adjust to parenthood.
000020400.WAV|And we can adjust his or her chemotherapy doses to minimise side effects while maximising the chance of a cure.
000021403.WAV|Rising college debt has been a widely discussed matter.
000021404.WAV|Mary and her family were moving to another city.
000021405.WAV|The party had a cool vibe but was for guests only.
000021406.WAV|I live in Singapore.
000021407.WAV|Women hope for skin that is soft to the touch.
000021409.WAV|The new movie about food promises a visual feast.
000021411.WAV|The earth’s core is made of iron and nickel.
000021413.WAV|It is easy to book flights and hotels on the computer.
000021415.WAV|The detective tracked down the cat killer quickly.
000021416.WAV|After a hot day, all I want to do is take a bath.
000021418.WAV|Soon, the menacing pack began to approach the poor outnumbered family.
000021419.WAV|A pinch of salt is enough to make a veal stew tasty.
000021420.WAV|For a sunny place like Singapore, not many people wear a hat.
000021421.WAV|The nurse folded a paper jib for the little boy’s yacht model.
000021422.WAV|It is not safe to freeze something again after it has thawed.
000021423.WAV|The shop keeps its costs low by buying its supplies in bulk.
000021424.WAV|He thought he’s brave for saying the truth but he’s actually just adding fuel to the fire.

000021719.WAV|People with a sweet tooth may be surprised at a fantastic chocolate fondue in a Japanese buffet place.
000021720.WAV|But I think because there are so many choices now, you have to be really, really good.
000021722.WAV|The focus on large warehouses will remain, but it will be tempered by other priorities.
000021723.WAV|But it is also possible to see Opposition parties joining forces to contest constituencies.

000021745.WAV|How wretched our lives are!
000021746.WAV|Thundery showers are expected mainly over northern and western Singapore in the afternoon.
000021748.WAV|And, of course, reminiscing about the insect bites, sunburn and blisters that were all part of the experience.

000021769.WAV|Passengers on two trains had to disembark.
000021771.WAV|The writing is on the wall globally.

000021777.WAV|He added that most commuters were able to get to their destinations via alternative services provided, although they experienced delays.
000021778.WAV|But the frequent late nights spent at work took their toll.

000021780.WAV|As the seemingly ageless Stewart notes, there is no template for growing old as a rock star.
